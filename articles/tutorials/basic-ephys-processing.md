title: Basic Ephys Data Processing in Bonsai
---

This tutorial shows how to use ONIX hardware and the OpenEphys.Onix1 Bonsai package to perform basic online signal
processing on electrophysiology data in Bonsai such as channel selection and reordering, frequency filtering and event
detection (in this example, spike detection using a fixed threshold crossing).

This type of processing is helpful for visualizing data during acquisition and can be a starting point for more advanced
workflows such as closed-loop experiments. For specialized data visualizations from very dense arrays like Neuropixels
probes, for example, we recommend piping that data to the Open Ephys GUI.

<!-- Event detection in Bonsai will be faster and it allows actuation using ONIX or other hardware for closed-loop
applications. However, more advanced event detection algorithms such as spike sorting, ripple detection, etc. need
specific implementations in Bonsai. -->
<!-- I'm not sure we need to discuss what this tutorial doesn't do -->

This tutorial guides you through building the following workflow: 

::: workflow
![/workflows/tutorials/basic-ephys-processing/spikes.bonsai workflow](../../workflows/tutorials/basic-ephys-processing/spikes.bonsai)
:::

> [!NOTE]
> Although this tutorial uses headstage64 as an example, the process is similar for other ephys headstages. This
> tutorial assumes you are familiar with the [hardware guide](xref:hardware) of the ONIX headstage you intend to use.
> Use this [reference](xref:reference) for which ephys <xref:dataio> and scaling you need to use for each headstage, and links to relevant
> documentation. 

## Set up and get started in Bonsai

Follow the [Getting Started](xref:getting-started) guide to set up and get familiarized with Bonsai. In particular:

- [Download the necessary Bonsai packages](xref:install-configure-bonsai#install-packages-in-bonsai) or 
[check for updates](xref:install-configure-bonsai#update-packages-in-bonsai). This tutorial assumes 
you're using the latest software.
- Read about [visualizing data](xref:visualize-data) since we recommend checking each step of the tutorial by visualizing the data produced but we don't cover it here.

## Configure the hardware

::: workflow
![/workflows/tutorials/basic-ephys-processing/configuration.bonsai workflow](../../workflows/tutorials/basic-ephys-processing/configuration.bonsai)
:::

Construct a [top-level hardware configuration chain](xref:initialize-onicontext): 

1. Place the [configuration operators](xref:configure) that correspond to the hardware you intend to use between
<xref:OpenEphys.Onix1.CreateContext> and <xref:OpenEphys.Onix1.StartAcquisition>. In this example, these are
<xref:OpenEphys.Onix1.ConfigureHeadstage64> and <xref:OpenEphys.Onix1.ConfigureBreakoutBoard>.
1. Confirm that the device that streams electrophysiology data is enabled. The Rhd2164 device (an Intan amplifier) on
the headstage64 is the only device used in this tutorial, so you could disable other devices on the headstage and on the
breakout board to improve performance if you wanted to.

## Stream ephys data into Bonsai

::: workflow
![/workflows/tutorials/basic-ephys-processing/ephys-data.bonsai workflow](../../workflows/tutorials/basic-ephys-processing/ephys-data.bonsai)
:::

Place the relevant operators to stream electrophysiology data from your headstage:

1. Because the device on headstage64 that streams electrophysiology data is the Rhd2164 Intan amplifier, we placed the
<xref:OpenEphys.Onix1.Rhd2164Data> node onto the workflow. Use this [reference](xref:reference) to find the ephys data operator
that corresponds to each device.
1. Select the relevant members from the data frames that the data operator produces. In this example, the relevant members are "AmplifierData" and "Clock". To select those members, right-click the `Rhd2164` node, hover over the output option in the context menu, and select it from
the list.
1. Visualize the raw data to confirm that the ephys data operator is streaming data. 

## Select and reorder channels

::: workflow
![/workflows/tutorials/basic-ephys-processing/select-convert-ephys-data.bonsai workflow](../../workflows/tutorials/basic-ephys-processing/select-convert-ephys-data.bonsai)
:::

Connect a <xref:Bonsai.Dsp.SelectChannels> operator to the electrophysiology data stream and edit its "Channels" property.

- Remember indexing in Bonsai starts at 0.
- Use commas to list multiple channels and brackets for ranges.
- Reorder channels by listing the channel numbers in the order in which you want to visualize the channels.

## Convert ephys data to microvolts

::: workflow
![/workflows/tutorials/basic-ephys-processing/select-convert-ephys-data.bonsai workflow](../../workflows/tutorials/basic-ephys-processing/select-convert-ephys-data.bonsai)
:::

### Center the signal around zero
Connect a <xref:Bonsai.Dsp.ConvertScale> operator to the `SelectChannels` operator and set its properties:
- Edit its "Shift" property to subtract 2^bit depth - 1^ from the signal. Use this [reference](xref:reference) to find
the Shift necessary for each device. In this example, we "Shift" -32768 because the Rhd2164 device outputs unsigned
16-bit data.
- Set the "Depth" property to F32 because this bit depth is required to correctly represent scaled data from all
devices.

### Scale the signal to microvolts
Connect a second `ConvertScale` operator to the first `ConvertScale` operator and set its properties:
- Edit its "Scale" property to multiply the signal by a scalar in order to get microvolt values. This scalar is
determined by the gain of the amplifier and resolution the ADC contained in the amplifier device. Use this 
[reference](xref:reference) to find the "Scale" necessary for each device. In this example, we "Scale" by 0.195 because
the Rhd2164 device on headstage64 has a step size of 0.195&nbsp;Î¼V/bit
- Keep the "Depth" property at F32.

Visualize the transformed data to confirm the output of the shifting and scaling operations
worked as expected, i.e. that the signal is centered around zero and that the values make sense in microvolts.

> [!NOTE]
> Although both the Shift and Scale calculation can be done in one `ConvertScale` operator, the calculations are
> more straightforward using two operators connected in series because the `ConvertScale` operator applies the
> "Shift" offset after applying the "Scale" scalar so if we used a single operator, we would have to scale the Shift
> parameter.

## Apply a filter

::: workflow
![/workflows/tutorials/basic-ephys-processing/filter-ephys-data.bonsai workflow](../../workflows/tutorials/basic-ephys-processing/filter-ephys-data.bonsai)
:::

Connect a `FrequencyFilter` operator to the second `ConvertScale` operator and set its properties.
- Set its "SampleRate" property to 30000. Ephys data in all devices is 30 kHz.
- Set the "FilterType" property to an adequate type. In this example, we use a high pass filter to look at spikes.
- Set the "Cutoff1" and "Cutoff2" properties to an adequate value. In this example, we use 300 Hz as the
    lower cutoff frequency. 

Visualize the filtered data.

> [!TIP] 
> If you choose to save data, we recommend you place the `MatrixWriter` operator before filtering and scaling to save raw
> data instead of scaled or filtered data. Filtering with the `FrequencyFilter` operator before recording could remove signals from a bandwidth of interest and converting to microvolts with the second `ConvertScale` operator could increase the size of your data without increasing meaningful information.

## Detect events

::: workflow
![/workflows/tutorials/basic-ephys-processing/spike-detection.bonsai workflow](../../workflows/tutorials/basic-ephys-processing/spike-detection.bonsai)
:::

Based on the amplitude of the signal on the selected channel, set a fixed threshold for detecting spikes. <!-- discuss these details? -->

Visualize the spike data.

> [!TIP] 
> You can test the spike detection using a pre-recorded data known to have spikes: recreate the
> workflow from this example without the hardware configuration chain in a new workflow and replace the ephys data node (in the case of the headstage64, replace
> the `Rhd2164` node) with a `MatrixReader` that reads from the file containing spiking ephys data in unsigned 16-bit format.
