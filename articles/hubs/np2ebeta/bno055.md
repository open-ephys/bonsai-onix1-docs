This graph generates orientation data from the headstage's Bno055, writes it to a .csv file, selects the `Quaternion` member from the Bno055 data frame, and automates commutation of the headstage tether from that `Quaternion` member.

- The <xref:OpenEphys.Onix1.NeuropixelsV2eBno055Data> operator generates a sequence of <xref:OpenEphys.Onix1.Bno055DataFrame>s. This is accomplished by changing the following <xref:OpenEphys.Onix1.NeuropixelsV2eBno055Data> properties from their default values:
    - The `DeviceName` is set to "NeuropixelsV2eHeadstage/NeuropixelsV2eBno055". This links the <xref:OpenEphys.Onix1.NeuropixelsV2eBno055Data> operator to the corresponding configuration operator. 
- The [`CsvWriter`](https://bonsai-rx.org/docs/api/Bonsai.IO.CsvWriter.html) operator saves the `Clock`, `BytesUsed`, and `PercentUsed` mmebers to a file with the following format: `memory-use_<timestamp>.csv`. Because [`CsvWriter`](https://bonsai-rx.org/docs/api/Bonsai.IO.CsvWriter.html) is a _sink_ operator, its output sequence is equivalent to its input sequence. In other words, its output is equivalent to <xref:OpenEphys.Onix1.Bno055DataFrame>'s output. Therefore, it's possible to use a [`MemberSelector`](https://bonsai-rx.org/docs/api/Bonsai.Expressions.MemberSelectorBuilder.html) operator on the [`CsvWriter`](https://bonsai-rx.org/docs/api/Bonsai.IO.CsvWriter.html) to select members from <xref:OpenEphys.Onix1.Bno055DataFrame>.
- The [`MemberSelector`](https://bonsai-rx.org/docs/api/Bonsai.Expressions.MemberSelectorBuilder.html) operator selects the `Quartnernion` member from the.
- The `AutoCommutator` operator automatically commutates the headstage provided that there is a proper commutator connection.
