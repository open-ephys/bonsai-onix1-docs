This graph generates Neuropixels 2.0 data, selects the `Clock` and `AmplifierData` members from the Neuropixels 2.0 data frame, and writes those members to various files.

- The <xref:OpenEphys.Onix1.NeuropixelsV2eBetaData> operator generates a sequence of <xref:OpenEphys.Onix1.NeuropixelsV2eBetaDataFrame>s. This is accomplished by changing the following <xref:OpenEphys.Onix1.NeuropixelsV2eBetaData> properties from their default values:
    - The `DeviceName` is set to "NeuropixelsV2eBetaHeadstage/NeuropixelsV2eBeta". This links the <xref:OpenEphys.Onix1.NeuropixelsV2eBetaData> operator to the corresponding configuration operator. 
    - The `ProbeIndex` is set to "ProbeA". This links the data generated by this probe to the probe in the headstage's port A. 
    - To learn about considerations setting the `Buffer` property, visit the <xref:buffers-memory-usage>.
- The [`MemberSelector`](https://bonsai-rx.org/docs/api/Bonsai.Expressions.MemberSelectorBuilder.html) operators each select a member from the <xref:OpenEphys.Onix1.NeuropixelsV2eBetaDataFrame>, `Clock` and `AmplifierData`. 
- The [`MatrixWriter`](https://bonsai-rx.org/docs/api/Bonsai.Dsp.MatrixWriter.html) operators saves the selected members to files with the following format: `np2beta-a-clock_<timestamp>.raw` and `np2beta-a-amp<timestamp>.raw`, respectively. 

The bottom processing graph is an exact copy of the top half except it's set to output data from a different probe and it's disabled. It can be enabled (by selecting those nodes and pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd> or clicking `Enable` in the context menu that appears after right-clicking them) if you want to record from two probes.
