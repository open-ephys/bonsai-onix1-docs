- [IMEC Neuropixels 2.0](xref:np2e_np2) x2:
    - Either 1x or 4x silicon shanks with a 70 x 24 Âµm cross-section.
    - 1280 electrodes low-impedance TiN electrodes per shank (5120 total)
    - 384 parallel, full-band (AP, LFP), low-noise recording channels.
- [Bno055](xref:np2e_bno055): 9-axis IMU for real-time, 3D orientation tracking and easy automated commutation with Open Ephys commutators.
