Continue browsing <xref:GettingStarted> and check out specific nodes on the left to see how to configure each node, as well as some ways to visualize data. Each page will have a fully functional workflow that can be copied into Bonsai to provide an easy starting point for generating data.

For more technical information on each node, head to the <xref:OpenEphys.Onix1> to see a more developer-focused view of each node.

More complex and in-depth tutorials for placing multiple nodes and moving towards generating data in an experimental setting can be found in the <xref:TutorialsLandingPage>.
