Welcome to the user guide! The next few pages are dedicated to users who are unfamiliar with ONIX and Bonsai, and will teach them what ONIX is, how to download and install Bonsai, open a new file, place operators (and understand what an operator is), reorder a workflow, run a workflow, and finally visualize data.

For those who are already familiar with Bonsai and are looking for a particular device or headstage to learn more about the hardware and how to utilize it, the table of contents on the left contains entries for each available device and headstage. Choose a page to learn more about the hardware and view a fully complete workflow that can be copied directly into Bonsai to aid in quickly setting up and collecting data from a system.
