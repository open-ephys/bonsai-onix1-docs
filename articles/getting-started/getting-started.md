Welcome to the user guide! The next few pages will teach you what ONIX is, how to download and install Bonsai, open a new file, place operators (and understand what an operator is), reorder a workflow, run a workflow, and visualize data.

Those who are already familiar with Bonsai and are looking for how to acquire data from a particular device or headstage should have a look at the the table of contents on the left, which contains entries for each all hardware supported by the library. Choose a page to learn more about the hardware and view a functional workflow that can be copy/pasted directly into Bonsai to aid in quickly setting up and collecting data from a system.
