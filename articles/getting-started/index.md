Welcome to the user guide! These pages are for users to learn how to use ONIX hardware through
the OpenEphys.Onix1 Bonsai package. Browse the articles in the table of contents to learn more.

This software documentation is intended to be used hand-in-hand with the [Hardware
documentation](https://open-ephys.github.io/onix-docs/index.html) to learn about and start using
ONIX hardware. 

For those who are looking for user guides and example workflows for using a particular device or
