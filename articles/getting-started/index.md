Welcome to the user guide! The next few pages will teach you what ONIX is, how to download and install Bonsai, open a new file, place operators (and understand what an operator is), reorder a workflow, run a workflow, and visualize data.

Those who are already familiar with Bonsai and are looking for how to acquire data from particular Onix hardware, visit the <xref:hardware> page. These guides contain functional workflow that can be copy/pasted directly into Bonsai to aid in quickly setting up and collecting data from a system as well as explanations for those workflows and scripts for loading data.
