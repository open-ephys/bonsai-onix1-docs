## Install Bonsai

To download Bonsai, select between the portable download and the installer download [here](https://bonsai-rx.org/docs/articles/installation.html).

*   The **Portable** download installs a sandboxed version of Bonsai. Portable environments enable users to switch between different environments to prevent package conflicts or confusion between similar packages.

    *   To install from the **Portable** download, extract the downloaded file. You can start the portable Bonsai by running the `Bonsai.exe` that is inside the extracted folder.

*   The **Installer** download installs Bonsai and all its dependencies globally.

    *   To install from the **Installer** download, run the downloaded `Bonsai-X.X.X.exe` file and agree to the involved licenses. You can start the globally installed Bonsai by launching it from the `Bonsai Setup` window after installing or searching for it in your OS's search function, for example. You can create a shortcut such that the portable Bonsai environment is easy and name it such that it is easy to differentiate between different environments. 

To use Bonsai for interfacing with Open Ephys hardware in a meaningful way, additional packages are required.

## Open Bonsai Package Manager

The Bonsai package manager can be accessed from Bonsai's landing window or its workflow editor:

## Next Steps

Now that Bonsai has been installed and configured, it is time to start placing operators and configuring those. If you are new to Bonsai, the following sections give a high-level understanding of how Bonsai is organized, and some of the ONIX-specific concepts that will be useful for learning how to work with the operators.
