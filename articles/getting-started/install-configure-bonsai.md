## Bonsai Installation

To download Bonsai, select between the portable download and the installer download
[here](https://bonsai-rx.org/docs/articles/installation.html).

*   The **Portable** download (.zip) installs a sand-boxed version of Bonsai. Portable environments
    enable users to switch between different environments to prevent package conflicts or user
    different versions of packages.
    *   To install from the **Portable** download, extract the downloaded file. You can start the
        portable Bonsai by running the `Bonsai.exe` that is inside the extracted folder.
*   The **Installer** download (.exe) installs Bonsai and all its dependencies globally.
    *   To install from the **Installer** download, run the downloaded `Bonsai-X.X.X.exe` file and
        agree to the involved licenses. You can start the globally installed Bonsai by launching it
        from the `Bonsai Setup` window after installing or searching for it in your OS's search
        function, for example. 

> [!TIP]
> When using multiple environments, create and name shortcuts such that different Bonsai
> environments are easier to find and distinguish. 

## Package Installation

Bonsai packages expand the set of operators available to you for building useful workflows. For
example, the `OpenEphys.Onix1` package is required to interface with Onix hardware through Bonsai.

### Open the Bonsai Package Manager 

The Bonsai package manager can be accessed from Bonsai's landing window or its workflow editor:

### Install Packages

The following packages are required to run the workflows in this documentation are:

* `OpenEphys.Onix1.Design`: An extension of the `OpenEphys.Onix1` library that includes graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Installing OpenEphys.Onix1.Design automatically installs `OpenEphys.Onix1` as a dependency.
* `Bonsai.StarterPack`: the "standard library" for Bonsai that contains tools that are used in almost every workflow.
* `OpenEphys.Commutator`: for controlling Open Ephys commutators.
* `OpenEphys.Sockets.Bonsai`: for establishing TCP Sockets (to stream data to the Open Ephys GUI, for example).

> [!TIP]
> Additional packages will allow you to extend the functionality of ONIX hardware beyond the scope
> of this documentation. There are packages that allow ONIX be combined with [visual
> psychophysics](https://bonsai-rx.org/docs/tutorials/vision-psychophysics.html), [marker-less pose
> estimation](https://bonsai-rx.org/sleap/), [HARP behavioral devices](https://harp-tech.org/), and
> much more.

To install packages, open the package manager and:

1.  Click the `Browse` tab.
1.  Set `Package source` to `All`.
1.  Search for the exact package name listed above, e.g. `OpenEphys.Onix1.Design`.
1.  Click `Install`.
1.  If a license agreement window appears, click `I Accept`.
