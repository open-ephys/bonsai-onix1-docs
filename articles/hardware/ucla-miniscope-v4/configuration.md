## Configuring the UCLA Miniscope v4
The `UclaMiniscopeV4` operator is set to configure the UCLA Miniscope v4; this can enable streaming of video data from a
Python480 sensor and orientation data from a Bno055 IMU. This is accomplished in the UCLA Miniscope v4 example workflow by
leaving all of the `UclaMiniscopeV4` properties set to their default values.
