## Configuring the Breakout Board and Headstage Rhs2116

The `ConfigureBreakoutBoard` operator configures the Onix Breakout Board. In the Headstage Rhs2116
example tutorial, it is configured to enable digital inputs to serve as a trigger for the Headstage
Rhs2116's electrical and optical stimulation and to enable monitoring of the percentage of memory
occupied. This is accomplished by leaving all of the `ConfigureBreakoutBoard` properties set to
their default values except its Memory Monitor Enable property is set to "True". 

The `ConfigureHeadstageRhs2116` operator is used to configure the Headstage Rhs2116. In the
Headstage Rhs2116 example tutorial, it is configured to enable streaming of electrophysiology data
from a Rhs2116 amplifier, orientation data from the on-board Bno055 IMU, and position data from the
Ts4231. This is accomplished in the Headstage Rhs2116 example workflow by leaving all of the
`ConfigureHeadstageRhs2116` properties set to their default values.
