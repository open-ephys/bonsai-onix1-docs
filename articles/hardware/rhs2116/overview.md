These are the devices available on the Headstage Rhs2116:

- [Rhs2116 Pair](xref:rhs2116):
  - 32 electrophysiology channels that are independently configurable to record electrophysiological signals from or
  deliver electrical stimuli to passive probes.
    - 30193.2367 Hz sample rate with 16 bit depth
    - Adjustable analog band-pass filter:
      - Lower cutoff configurable from 0.1 Hz to 1 kHz
      - Upper cutoff configurable from 100 Hz to 20 kHz
      - Lower cutoff during recovery immediately after stimulus configurable from 0.1 Hz to 1 kHz
    - Optional adjustable digital high-pass filter with cutoff configurable from 0.146 Hz to 3.309 kHz
- [Electrical Stimulation](xref:rhs2116_stimulate): Single current source with Â±15V compliance voltage and automatic electrode discharge
    - The stimulation waveform is highly configurable via the <xref:OpenEphys.Onix1.Rhs2116StimulusTrigger>'s properties.
