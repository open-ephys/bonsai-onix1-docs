The following excerpt from the HeadstageRhs2116 [example workflow](xref:rhs2116)
demonstrates the Rhs2116 recording functionality by streaming and saving data
from the Rhs2116 device.

The <xref:OpenEphys.Onix1.Rhs2116PairData> operator generates a sequence of
[Rhs2116PairDataFrames](xref:OpenEphys.Onix1.Rhs2116DataFrame) using the following
settings:
- The BufferSize property is set to 30. Each `Rhs2116PairDataFrame` will contain a
  [1 x 30 sample] Clock vector, a [32 channel x 30 sample] AmplifierData matrix,
  a [32 channel x 30 sample] DcData matrix, and [1 channel x 30 sample] recovery
  mask vector. This corresponds to 1 ms of data per data frame.
- The DeviceName property is set to "HeadstageRhs2116/Rhs2116". This links
  `Rhs2116PairData` to the Rhs2116s on the Headstage Rhs2116.

The relevant properties are extracted from the
<xref:OpenEphys.Onix1.Rhs2116PairDataFrame> by right-clicking the `Rhs2116PairData`
operator, and choosing the following Output members: Clock, AmplifierData, and
DcData. The <xref:Bonsai.Dsp.MatrixWriter>s save the selected members to files
with the following formats: `rhs2116pair-clock_<filecount>.raw`,
`rhs2116pair-ac_<filecount>.raw`, `rhs2116pair-dc_<filecount>.raw`, and
`rhs2116pair-recovery_<filecount>.raw` respectively.
