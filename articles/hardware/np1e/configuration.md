The `NeuropixelsV1eHeadstage` operator is set to configure the Neuropixels V1e Headstage to enable streaming electrophysiology data from a Neuropixels 1.0 probe and orientation data from a Bno055 IMU. This is accomplished in the Neuropixels V1e Headstage example workflow by leaving all of the `NeuropixelsV1eHeadstage` properties set to their default values.
