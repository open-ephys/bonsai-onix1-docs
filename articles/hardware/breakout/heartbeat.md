hardware: true

ONIX has a single special device, called a heartbeat, that produces data at regular intervals and is always enabled.
When data is read from the hardware by software, the reading thread will block until enough data has been produced by
the hardware. If no devices are enabled, the software would block forever. The heartbeat prevents this from happening
since it is always enabled and always producing data. In practice, you can ignore the heartbeat functionality. In any
case, the following excerpt from the Breakout Board [example workflow](xref:breakout_workflow) demonstrates how to
observe the heartbeat.

The <xref:OpenEphys.Onix1.HeartbeatData> operator generates a sequence of
[HeartbeatDataFrames](xref:OpenEphys.Onix1.HeartbeatDataFrame). `HeartbeatData` emits `HeartbeatDataFrames` at a regular
interval defined during <xref:breakout_configuration> using the <xref:OpenEphys.Onix1.ConfigureBreakoutBoard>'s
`Heartbeat BeatsPerSecond` property (in our case 10 Hz). The `HeartbeatData`'s `DeviceName` property is set to
"BreakoutBoard/Heartbeat". This links the `HeartbeatData` operator to the corresponding configuration operator. The
[MemberSelector](xref:Bonsai.Expressions.MemberSelectorBuilder) operator selects the
`Clock` member from the `HeartbeatDataFrame` so the user can visualize the number of clock cycles that have passed for
a given heartbeat pulse if they double-click the `Clock` node.
