title: Breakout Board
---

The breakout board acts as the central interface for headstages, miniscopes, and
auxiliary IO to communicate with the computer. It provides the following
features:

1. Headstage IO: 2x high-bandwidth, general-purpose headstage communication ports
1. [Digital Input](xref:breakout_digital-inputs): 8 bits GPI and button state, 5V tolerant, 4 MHz/channel.
1. [Digital Output](xref:breakout_digital-outputs): 8 bits of GPO updated at 4 MHz/channel.
1. [Analog IO](xref:breakout_analog-io)
    - 12 channels, 100 kHz per channel, independently configurable as input or output.
    - [Input](xref:breakout_analog-io#analog-inputs): independently configurable as ±2.5V, ±5V, or ±10V input voltage range.
    - [Output](xref:breakout_analog-io#analog-outputs): fixed ±10V output voltage range.
1. [Clock Output](xref:breakout_clock-output): A programmable-frequency clock that is hardware-synchronized to acquisition
    - Allows breakout board to drive external hardware acquisition.
    - Note: _disabled by default_.
1. [Harp Input](xref:breakout_harp-sync): An input for a [Harp](https://harp-tech.org/) behavioral synchronization signal.
1. [Heartbeat](xref:breakout_heartbeat)
    - Periodic signal from host with adjustable beat frequency.
1. [Memory Monitor](xref:breakout_memory-monitor)
    - Diagnostic device for monitoring hardware first-in, first-out memory use.
    - Used for tune real-time feedback loops for minimal latency.
    - Note: _disabled by default_.
