title: Breakout Board Example Workflow
---

In this example, we will explore the breakout board's functionality by demoing its capabilities. The workflow below can by copy/pasted into the Bonsai editor using the clipboard icon in the top right. This workflow:
- Captures data from the analog and digital inputs on the breakout board and streams them to disk.
- Generates signals to drive the breakout boards analog and digital outputs.
- Monitors and saves hardware memory buffer use information.
- Monitors the breakout board's heartbeat signal.
