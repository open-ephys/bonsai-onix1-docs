The following excerpt from the Headstage64 [example workflow](xref:hs64_hs64) demonstrates the headstage's position tracking capabilities.

The <xref:OpenEphys.Onix1.TS4231V1PositionData> operator generates a sequence of [TS4231V1PositionDataFrames](xref:OpenEphys.Onix1.TS4231V1PositionDataFrame). `TS4231V1PositionData` emits a `TS4231V1PositionDataFrame` when a receiver on the headstage successfully receives a coordinated set of four IR sweeps - two from each lighthouse. These coordinated sweeps occur at a rate of 30 Hz, so the maximum achievable sample rate is 30 Hz. In practice, the sample rate depends on the conditions of the behavioral arena. Achieving a 30 Hz sample rate requires that that the receiver is within range of the lighthouses and that there is no occlusion between the receiver and the lighthouses. There are four receivers on the headstage64 to increase the likelihood that at least one of them successfully receiving a complete lighthouse signal. Each receiver that successfully receives the full lighthouse signal results in `TS4231V1PositionData` emitting a `TS4231V1PositionDataFrame`. This means it is possible for the `TS4231V1PositionData` operator to emit multiple `TS4231V1PositionDataFrames` for a given set of coordinated sweeps.
