title: Headstage64 Position Data
---

The following excerpt from the Headstage64 [example workflow](xref:hs64_hs64) demonstrates the Headstage64's position
tracking capabilities.

The <xref:OpenEphys.Onix1.TS4231V1PositionData> operator generates a sequence of
[TS4231V1PositionDataFrames](xref:OpenEphys.Onix1.TS4231V1PositionDataFrame). A `TS4231V1PositionDataFrame` is emitted
when a receiver on the Headstage64 captures a sequence of 12 optical signals from a pair of lighthouses which occurs at
30 Hz. Therefore, with no occlusions, the maximum achievable sample rate is 30 Hz per receiver. There are three
receivers on the Headstage64, so `TS4231V1PositionData` can emit up to 3 `TS4231V1PositionDataFrames` in a single 30 Hz
sampling cycle. Of course, if occlusions cause receivers to miss optical signals, this rate will be reduced. 

The `TS4231V1PositionData`'s `DeviceName` property is set to "Headstage64/TS4231V1". This links the
`TS4231V1PositionData` operator to the corresponding configuration operator.

The [CsvWriter](https://bonsai-rx.org/docs/api/Bonsai.IO.CsvWriter.html) operator writes the `Clock`, and `Position`
members from the `TS4231V1PositionDataFrame` to a file with the following name format: `ts4231v1__<timestamp>.csv`.
Because `CsvWriter` is a _sink_ operator, its output sequence is equivalent to its input sequence. In other words, its
output is equivalent to `TS4231V1PositionData`'s output. Therefore, it's possible to use
[MemberSelector](https://bonsai-rx.org/docs/api/Bonsai.Expressions.MemberSelectorBuilder.html) operators on the
`CsvWriter` to select members from `TS4231V1PositionDataFrame`. This is most easily performed by clicking the relevant
members that appear by hovering over the "Output" option that appears in the context menu that appears after
right-clicking the `CsvWriter` node. The <xref:OpenEphys.Onix1.TS4231V1PositionDataFrame.Position> member is selected in
the workflow to help visualize the position data by double-clicking the node when the workflow is running
