title: Headstage 64 Electrical Stimulation
---

The following excerpt from the Headstage64 [example workflow](xref:hs64_workflow) demonstrates electrical stimulation by
triggering a train of pulses following a press of the â–³ key on the breakout board.

The <xref:OpenEphys.Onix1.DigitalInput> operator generates a sequence of <xref:OpenEphys.Onix1.DigitalInputDataFrame>s.
Although the digital inputs are sampled at 4 Mhz, these data frames are only emitted when the port status changes (i.e.,
when a pin, button, or switch is toggled). In the Breakout Board example workflow, the `DigitalInput`'s `DeviceName`
property is set to "BreakoutBoard/DigitalInput". This links the `DigitalInput` operator to the corresponding
configuration operator. 

<xref:OpenEphys.Onix1.BreakoutButtonState> is selected from the `DigitalInputDataFrame`. It is an enumerator with values
that correspond to bit positions of the breakout board's digital port. When this type is connected to a `HasFlags`
operator, the enumerated values appear in the `HasFlags`'s `Value` property's dropdown menu. Because `HasFlags`'s
`Value` is set to "Triangle", its output is "True" when the selected `BreakoutButtonState` bit field contains the
"Triangle" flag.

When the <xref:OpenEphys.Onix1.Headstage64ElectricalStimulatorTrigger> operator receives a "True" value in its input
sequence, a stimulus waveform is triggered. The waveform can be modified by editing the
`Headstage64ElectricalStimulatorTrig` operator's properties.
