> [!NOTE]
> The NeuropixelsV2eBeta Headstage functions nearly identically to the NeuropixelsV2e Headstage. Simply replace `NeuropixelsV2eData` with `NeuropixelsV2eBetaData` and set its `DeviceName` property to "NeuropixelsV2eBetaHeadstage/NeuropixelsV2eBeta". 

The following excerpt from the NeuropixelsV2e Headstage [example workflow](xref:np2e) demonstrates Neuropixels 2.0 probe functionality by streaming data and saves Neuropixels 2.0 probe data. The second chain  is disabled by default, assuming that only one probe is connected to the headstage. If two probes are connected, the second `NeuropixelsV2eData` chain can be enabled to stream data from both probes simultaneously. To enable, select all nodes in the disabled chain and press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd>, or click `Enable` right-clicking the selected nodes.

The <xref:OpenEphys.Onix1.NeuropixelsV2eData> operator generates a sequence of <xref:OpenEphys.Onix1.NeuropixelsV2eDataFrame>s. In the NeuropixelsV2e Headstage example workflow,
- `BufferSize` is set to 30. Therefore, each frame will contain a [1 x 30 sample] `Clock` vector and a [384 channel x
  30 sample] `AmplifierData` matrix. The Neuropixels 2.0 probe samples at 30 kHz per channel so this
  corresponds to 1 ms of data.
- `DeviceName` property is set to "NeuropixelsV2eHeadstage/NeuropixelsV2e". This links the `NeuropixelsV2eData` operator to the corresponding configuration operator. 
- `ProbeIndex` property is set to "ProbeA". This links the data generated by this probe to the probe in port A of the headstage. 

The relevant properties are extracted from the <xref:OpenEphys.Onix1.NeuropixelsV2eDataFrame> by right-clicking the <xref:OpenEphys.Onix1.NeuropixelsV2eData> operator, and choosing the following **Output** members: `Clock`, and `AmplifierData`. The [`MatrixWriter`](https://bonsai-rx.org/docs/api/Bonsai.Dsp.MatrixWriter.html) operators saves the selected members to files with the following format: `np2-a-clock_<filecount>.raw` and `np2-a-amp<filecount>.raw`, respectively.
