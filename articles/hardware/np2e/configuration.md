> The NeuropixelsV2eBeta Headstage functions nearly identically to the NeuropixelsV2e Headstage. Simply replace `ConfigureNeuropixelsV2eHeadstage` with `ConfigureNeuropixelsV2eBetaHeadstage`.

## Configuring the NeuropixelsV2e headstage
The `NeuropixelsV2eHeadstage` operator is set to configure the NeuropixelsV2e Headstage; this can enable streaming of electrophysiology data from a Neuropixels 2.0 probe and orientation data from a Bno055 IMU. This is accomplished in the NeuropixelsV2e Headstage example workflow by leaving all of the `NeuropixelsV2eHeadstage` properties set to their default values.

Default values for the headstage are:
- Enabling the first 384 electrodes of the first shank for streaming (shank 0, electrodes 0 through 383)
    - This is also known as the **Shank 0 Bank A** `Channel Preset`
- Setting the `Reference` to *External*

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The workflow will not run unless gain correction files are provided. Click the `NeuropixelsV2eHeadstage` operator, expand `NeuropixelsV2e` in the property pane, then choose the appropriate files by selecting either `GainCalibrationFileA` or `GainCalibrationFileB` and clicking the <kbd>...</kbd> button. If only one probe is plugged in, only one file is required.

> [!TIP]
> For additional details on how to manually configure the headstage, such as enabling specific electrodes for recording, or modify AP / LFP gain, check out the <xref:np2e_gui> page.
