These are the devices available on the NeuropixelsV2e Headstage:

- Supports up to two [IMEC Neuropixels 2.0 probes](xref:np2e_np2):
    - Either 1x or 4x silicon shanks with a 70 x 24 µm cross-section.
    - 1280 electrodes low-impedance TiN electrodes per shank (5120 total for quad-shank probes).
    - 384 parallel, full-band (AP, LFP), low-noise recording channels.
        - Bandwidth of 0.3-10 kHz, sampled at 30 kHz
- [Bno055](xref:np2e_bno055): 9-axis IMU for real-time, 3D orientation tracking sampled up to ~100 Hz for easy automated commutation with Open Ephys commutators.

> [!TIP]
> Visit the [NeuropixelsV2e Headstage Hardware Guide](https://open-ephys.github.io/onix-docs/Hardware%20Guide/Headstages/headstage-neuropix-2e.html) to learn more about the hardware such as weight, dimensions, and proper power voltages.

The example workflow below can by copy/pasted into the Bonsai editor using the clipboard icon in the top right. This workflow:
- Captures electrophysiology data from the Neuropixels 2.0 probe(s) and saves it to disk.
- Captures orientation data from the Bno055 IMU and saves it to disk.
- Monitors the NeuropixelsV2e Headstage port status
- Automatically commutates the tether if there is a proper commutator connection.

The following pages in the NeuropixelsV2e Headstage Guide provide a breakdown of the above example workflow.

> [!NOTE]
> The NeuropixelsV2eBeta Headstage example workflow (<a href="~/workflows/hardware/np2ebeta.bonsai" download>download here</a>) is nearly identical to the NeuropixelsV2e Headstage example workflow. Follow the pages in the NeuropixelsV2e Headstage Guide to learn how it works.
