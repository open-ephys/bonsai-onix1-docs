Core operators form a motif that serves as the basis of every workflow that interfaces with ONIX hardware. The motif involves [`CreateContext`](xref:OpenEphys.Onix1.CreateContext) and [`StartAcquisition`](xref:OpenEphys.Onix1.StartAcquisition) operators sandwiching one or multiple [configuration operators](xref:configure).
